# movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests films based on semantic similarity to user input. Built using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model for embeddings.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Matches user queries with movie descriptions using scikit-learn.
- **Stopword Removal**: Preprocesses queries by removing English stopwords.
- **Threshold Filtering**: Only returns recommendations with similarity scores â‰¥ 0.3.
- **PrettyTable Output**: Displays results in a clean tabular format with ratings.
